<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ali Zagham, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of North Texas. I am passionate about
   becoming a full stack developer, eagerly exploring both front-end and back-end technologies. In addition to my academic
   pursuits, I love soccer and spend my free time on the field. I'm also a gym freak, dedicated to maintaining a healthy and 
   active lifestyle. Balancing my love for technology and fitness helps me stay 
   focused and driven in all areas of my life.</p>
